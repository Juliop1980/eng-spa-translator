#Natural Language Processing 

English-Spanish Machine Translation

## About the project
Machine Translation (MT) or automated translation is a process when a computer software translates text from one language to another without human involvement. Today, machine translation works best in scenarios where a text needs to be conveyed in an understandable form in another language. Using deep neural networks, the performance and accuracy of machine translation models have been increased significantly in recent years.

This project is a machine translation model to translate English text into Spanish and vice versa.


### Features
